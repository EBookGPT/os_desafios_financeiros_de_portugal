This document reads like a dry academic paper, lacking any spark of life or engagement. It's a parade of bullet points and lifeless analysis, drowning in jargon and devoid of human connection.  The author needs to understand that **"show, don't tell"** is not just a writing principle, it's a lifeline for a reader struggling to stay afloat in this sea of facts.

Here's a breakdown of the issues and how to fix them:

**1. The Deadening Effect of Bullet Points:**

* **The Problem:** Bullet points are the executioner of narrative flow.  They chop up the text, creating a disjointed reading experience that feels more like a checklist than a story.
* **The Solution:**  Embrace paragraphs!  Weave those bullet points into a cohesive narrative.  Use transitions, connect ideas organically, and allow the reader to follow a train of thought instead of hopping between bullet points.

**2. Drowning in Jargon:**

* **The Problem:**  "Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento," "déficit público," "aversão ao risco" – these terms may be familiar to economists, but they're alienating to the average reader. 
* **The Solution:**  Define these terms in plain language, or illustrate them through concrete examples.  For instance, instead of saying "aversão ao risco," show a struggling entrepreneur being denied a loan because the bank perceives his business as too risky.

**3.  The Missing Human Element:**

* **The Problem:** The text focuses solely on the financial machinery, overlooking the human impact of these issues.  What are the stories of the people affected by these challenges? 
* **The Solution:** Introduce real people into the narrative.  A young graduate struggling to find a job due to the weak labor market, a family facing financial hardship due to rising housing costs, a small business owner struggling to access capital.  These stories will bring the text to life and make the challenges feel tangible. 

**4. The Lack of Dialogue:**

* **The Problem:**  Dialogue brings a sense of immediacy and personality. It allows the reader to hear different perspectives and engage with the issues on a more visceral level. 
* **The Solution:**  Incorporate dialogue into the narrative.  Imagine a conversation between a struggling entrepreneur and a loan officer, or a debate between two politicians about the best way to address the debt crisis. 

**5.  The Absence of Narrative Tension:**

* **The Problem:** The text lacks any sense of conflict or drama.  It presents the challenges in a purely factual manner, lacking any narrative momentum. 
* **The Solution:**  Introduce conflict and tension.  Highlight the struggle between different stakeholders, the clash of opposing viewpoints, the urgency of finding solutions.  Make the reader care about the outcome of these challenges.

**Example of a "Show, Don't Tell" Transformation:**

**Instead of:** 
* **The Impact on Consumption and Savings Capacity:** Explore how the high level of debt limits families' ability to consume and prevents them from building savings, affecting their ability to handle unexpected situations such as job loss or illness.

* Maria clutched the worn photo of her family as she stared at the eviction notice.  Two years ago, they'd been hopeful, moving into a bigger house they thought they could afford.  Now, the rising cost of living, combined with their hefty mortgage payments, had left them drowning in debt.  They'd cut back on everything: food, outings, even the kids' extra-curricular activities.  The dream of financial security felt as distant as the smile on her husband's face in the photo.  "We'll be alright," he had assured her.  But Maria wasn't so sure anymore.

**Remember:**  The goal is to use your words to paint a picture, to create a world that the reader can step into and experience firsthand. Don't just tell them about the challenges – show them. Let them see, hear, and feel the human cost of the financial struggles in Portugal.
